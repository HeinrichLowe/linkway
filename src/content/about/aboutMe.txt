I grew up fascinated by how things work—from computers to code. That curiosity eventually turned into a focused journey into programming. After leaving a Physics degree halfway through, I committed myself fully to software development.

Without formal experience in the industry, I’ve spent the past few years studying and building full-stack projects from scratch. From crafting clean and responsive interfaces with React and Tailwind, to developing RESTful APIs using Python, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL, I’ve been sharpening my skills with consistency and intention.

What drives me is the joy of building systems that make sense—both for users and developers. I value code quality, design patterns, and writing software that's maintainable and scalable.

Now, I’m ready to take the next step: joining a team where I can grow, contribute, and learn from experienced developers.
